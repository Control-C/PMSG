**ProxyLens** is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to help you stay aware of your screen time and reconnect with your body — using **PMSG smart glasses** for subtle, physical reminders and special blue lenses.

It bridges your browser and the physical world, turning time spent behind a screen into **gentle haptic or LED feedback**.

Part of the **PMSG ecosystem** — where interfaces are not just seen, but *felt*.
