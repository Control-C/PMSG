# PMSG WebBridge 🌐👓    WIP 
**Browser . Hardware . Body **

**PMSG WebBridge** is a browser-native interface layer that connects **web technologies** with **physical devices**, **AR experiences**, and **AI-driven perception**.

It enables direct interaction between:
- Web apps / Google chrome extions 
- PMSG devices via ( USB - BLE - API / Softmodem audio ) 
- AR scenes ([A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) / WebXR )
- AI models ( [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js))

No native apps.  
No heavy middleware.  
Just the browser — as an interface to the real world.
