**PMSG Stands for?**
The letters can stand for many things.
We often read S as Smart Glasses, while G can just as easily hint at GPT.
P and M are flexible too: Poor, Prototype, Private — but also Pebble, as a nod to sharing and extending the codebase.
At the same time, M stands for Modular, Mesh, and Maker-friendly — core ideas behind the project.
And yes, there’s a personal layer as well: P and M are also the initials of the project’s instigator, Paul Stefaan Mooij.
So PMSG is deliberately open-ended — a name that keeps you guessing, invites interpretation, and reflects how the project itself works.
