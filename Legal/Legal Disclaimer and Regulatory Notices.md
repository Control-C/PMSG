## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer and Regulatory Notices

**PMSG** ( Personal Monitoring Smart Glasses) is an **open-design, experimental, DIY testing project** provided strictly **AS IS** with **NO WARRANTIES** of any kind. It is **not** a certified consumer product, medical device, or ready-for-re-sale wearable.

### Project Purpose and Limitations
- This is a hobby/experimental prototype for personal testing, learning, and development only.
- Do **not** use in safety-critical, commercial, medical, or public-safety applications without full independent validation, testing, and certification.
- Any builds, modifications, or uses are at your own risk.

### Important Warnings – Use Responsibly
- **Driving / Road Use**: **Do NOT use PMSG (or any derivative) while driving or operating vehicles** unless you are 100% certain it does **not** distract you or obstruct your vision. In the Netherlands and EU, distracted driving is illegal (fines for handheld phones; similar principles apply to wearables). Heads-up displays, notifications, or any visual/audio elements could be seen as impairing attention — potentially leading to negligence claims in accidents. Always check current Dutch traffic laws (e.g., via government.nl or politie.nl) and your local regulations. **Mesh networking features must never be used while driving** if they require interaction or attention.
- **Mesh Networking / Off-Grid Comms**: Features like WiFi/BLE mesh are for experimental, short-range, personal use only. You **must** check and comply with local radio frequency laws, including EU Radio Equipment Directive (RED) rules on interference, power limits, and permitted bands. Unauthorized transmission could cause harmful interference or violate spectrum regulations — illegal in the EU/NL. Privacy note: Mesh networks may transmit data — ensure you comply with GDPR if personal data is involved.
- **Attachments / Modifications ("put stuff on them")**: Adding cameras, mics, heavy attachments, stickers, or any modifications could:
  - Obstruct your field of view → illegal under Dutch traffic rules (e.g., anything impairing vision).
  - Create safety hazards (sharp edges, weight imbalance, electrical risks).
  - Trigger privacy laws: If adding recording capabilities, you **must** obtain consent where required (GDPR in EU/NL strictly limits covert recording in public/private spaces; one-party consent for conversations you're in, but public filming has limits). Never record without considering others' privacy rights.
- **General Use**: Always verify compliance with **local laws** in your country/region regarding wearables, RF devices, privacy (GDPR), data protection, electrical safety, and product use. Laws change — what is okay today may not be tomorrow.

### CE / EU Regulatory Notes
- No CE marking, RED compliance, or testing has been done on this design.
- Wireless features (WiFi/BLE) may fall under the Radio Equipment Directive (2014/53/EU, updated 2022+ for cybersecurity/network protection).
- Users/builders **must** handle any required assessments, testing, and Declarations of Conformity if manufacturing/distributing.

### FCC / US Regulatory Notes
- No FCC testing or certification performed.
- Intentional radiators require compliance under Part 15 — your responsibility if selling/using in the US.
