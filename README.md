# PMSG
Introducing the Poor Men’s Smart Glasses (PMSG)—because who needs designer wearables when you’ve got DIY smarts and a pair old goggles? 🤓

Ever looked at your old sunglasses and thought, “These could use a little IoT love?” Well, now they can! The PMSG kit lets you swap out those boring old arms for a custom-made PCBA that looks and functions like something a hacker MacGyver would dream up. It fits just like the original—using the same hinges, screws, and probably duct tape somewhere—but now you’ve got space for sensors, connectors, and all the IoT magic you can pack onto your temples.

Perfect for those who want to look cool while tracking air quality, blinking Morse code, or… just pretending they’re Tony Stark. Now with 100% more tech nerd street cred.
