Introducing the **Poor Men‚Äôs Smart Glasses (PMSG)**‚Äîbecause who needs designer wearables when you‚Äôve got DIY smarts and a pair of old goggles? ü§ì

Ever looked at your old sunglasses and thought, *‚ÄúThese could use a little IoT love?‚Äù* Well, now they can! The PMSG kit lets you swap out those boring old arms for a custom-made PCBA that looks and functions like something a hacker MacGyver would dream up. It fits just like the original‚Äîusing the same hinges, screws, and probably duct tape somewhere‚Äîbut now you‚Äôve got space for sensors, connectors, and all the IoT magic you can pack onto your temples.

Perfect for those who want to look cool while tracking air quality, blinking Morse code, or‚Ä¶ just pretending they‚Äôre Tony Stark. **Now with 100% more tech nerd street cred**. üï∂Ô∏è

## How It Works

- Replace one (or both) arms of your glasses with a custom PCBA.
- The PCBA has special cutouts for hinges, making it easy to attach to any old frame.
- Add or remove sensors and connectors with ease‚Äîthink plug-and-play for your face!

## Parts List

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need to bring your PMSG to life:

- Old pair of safety glasses or sunglasses
- Custom PCBA (available in this repo)
- Hinges and screws (from the original glasses)
- Sensors (IoT-enabled sensors of your choice: e.g., air quality, light, temperature)
- Connectors (to hook your glasses up to the web or other devices)

## PCB Design

The PCB design includes:
- **Special cutouts** for attaching to standard eyewear hinges.
- **Mounting holes** for securing the arms to the glasses frame.
- Modular layout to easily add/remove components like sensors or IoT modules.

## Installation

1. Print the PCB from the `pcb_design` folder.
2. Use the original screws and hinges from your glasses to attach the PCBA.
3. Mount your sensors and connectors onto the provided slots on the PCBA.
